#summary Implementation of Step 2, 0.2

0.2 Code generation to GPL such as Java, C#, C++ or XML

Generate Java Beans (or some equivalent data structure in C#, Scala, etc.) with setters, getters and fields for the properties.

This step is intended to demonstrate code generation. In MPS, however, there is no real code generation per se. Everything is a model-to-model transformation (there is even a meta model for text (lines, words, lists)). 

Specifically, since MPS comes with an implementation of Java (called Base Language), generating Java Beans, as requested by this task, is actually the creation of a "Java model". 

Let us look at the implementation to make this clearer.
