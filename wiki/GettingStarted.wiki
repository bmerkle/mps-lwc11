This set of Wiki pages is the documentation for the LWC11 language workbench competition described here: http://www.languageworkbenches.net/

The PDF below outlines a task that will be implemented with various different language workbenches: http://www.delphino-consultancy.nl/lwc/contest.html

The task is relatively trivial. But it has been designed to illustrate as many properties of language workbenches as possible. As such, it can serve as a good introduction to the respective tools.

This tutorial expects that you have heard about MPS and how it works in general before. We start almost at the beginning, but not quite :-)
