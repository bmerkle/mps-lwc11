#summary Implementation of Step 1, 0.1

= Task =

0.1 Simple (structural) DSL without any fancy expression language or such.

Build a simple data definition language to define entities with properties. Properties have a name and a type. It should be possible to use primitive types for properties, as well as other Entities.

== Creating a Project, Language and Solution ==

To get started, we first create a new project using the File->New Project menu item. The name for the project is of course arbitrary, but we call it lwc11. When creating the project, the wizard prompts us to also create a language and a sandbox solution. We accept these proposals, and call the language _entities_, and the solution _lwc11demo_.  

The point of the solution created during projects set up is that this solution already has a _uses_ relationship with the language we create. In other words, you can directly create instances of the concepts defined in your _entities_ language in the solution.

The explorer should look something like the following after doing this.

== Creating the first language concepts ==

In MPS what is typically called a metaclass is called a language concept, or _concept_ for short. Because MPS is a projectional editor, languages are actually defined by first defining the structure of the language concepts. 

Based on the task we are supposed to implement, it is obvious that we need a language concept called _Entity_. So let's create it. In the _structure_ part of your _entities_ language select New->concept from the context menu. Name your new concept _Entity_ and make sure it implements the _INamedConcept_ interface. This adds a _name_ property to our new concept. Using the predefined interface is better than just adding a string property _name_, because a couple of default MPS functionalities depend on the _INamedConcept_ interface. You should also define an alias for your concept, the alias is the text string that is used to instantiate a concept in the editor, we will illustrate this below. The next screenshot shows the result of this step.

In MPS, projects contrain languages and solutions. A solution is a container for non-language things. A solution and alanguage in turn consist of models. A model corresponds to a physical resource, basically an XML file. Each model contains any number of root notes, which are instances of concepts that half there _can Be Root_ property set to _true_. In our example, we want to make sure that a model can contain several entities, so we add an additional language concept that acts as a container for entities and is itself a rootable concept. We call this concept _EntityReource_. Please use the same approach as above to create this new concept.

As we just said, the EntityResource should contain any number of entities. To enable this, we must add a child relationship the entity resource. The following screenshot should be self explaining and shows the result. Notice how the _instance can be root_ property is set to _true_.

At this point we are finished with the definition of the structure of our first two concepts. To make them usable in the editor we have to define the syntax, or in MPS terminology, the editor. Let's start with the entity.

If you double-click on your Entity concept, the structure editor for Entity should open. You can then select editor tab. If you click into the blank editor, you can create a new concept editor. After you do this you should have an empty editor, into which you can add your projection rules.
