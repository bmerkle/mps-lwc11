0.1 Simple (structural) DSL without any fancy expression language or such.

Build a simple data definition language to define entities with properties. Properties have a name and a type. It should be possible to use primitive types for properties, as well as other Entities.

== Creating a Language ==

To get started, we first create a new project using the File->New Project menu item. The name for the project is of course arbitrary, but we call it lwc11. When creating the project, the wizard prompts us to also create a language and a sandbox solution. We accept these proposals, and call the language _entities_, and the solution _lwc11demo_.  

The point of the solution created during projects set up is that this solution already has a _uses_ relationship with the language we create. In other words, you can directly create instances of the concepts defined in your _entities_ language in the solution.
